# MRT Transfer Data

> ðŸš‡ SG MRT line transfer data for the lazy or curious.

The data collated here has been converted to JSON format manually from various sources credited below.

Please reach out to me if you have any concerns or comments.

## Notes

> âš  This is a work-in-progress and I am tinkering around ðŸ¤ª

### Separation of data files

Data is separated into 2 files per train line - `{line}_walk.json` and `{line}.json`.
The former contains the walk transfer data (tapping in and out of stations) and the latter is for normal transfer data (within a station).

### Misc.

- A door number of 0 is given for cross-platform transfers.
- Time is in seconds.
- Some data is missing e.g. door numbers for some stations
